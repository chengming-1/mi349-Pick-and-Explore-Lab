<h2>Logic Statements</h2>
<p>The semicolon is used to separate JavaScript statements. Usually we add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement. (;)</p>
<p>JavaScript code is a sequence of JavaScript statements. The browser executes each statement sequentially in the order in which it was written.</p>
<p>JavaScript can be grouped together in batches. Code blocks begin with left curly braces and end with right curly braces. The purpose of the code blocks is to execute sequences of statements together.</p>
<p>A JavaScript statement usually begins with a statement identifier and is executed. The statement identifier is a reservation keyword that cannot be used as a variable name.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>JavaScript can output data in different ways:</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">Use window.alert() to pop up a warning box.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">Use document.write() to write content to an HTML document.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">Use innerHTML to write to the HTML element.</p>
<p style="text-indent:2em;">Use console.log() to write to the browser's console.</p>

<h2>Common Programming Statements</h2>
<p>Break: is used to break out of a loop.</p>
<p>Catch: executes the catch statement block if there is an execution error in the try statement block.</p>
<p>Continue: Skips an iteration in the loop.</p>
<p>do ... while: executes a statement block that continues while the conditional statement is true. while executing a statement block, which continues to execute the block if the conditional statement is true.</p>
<p>For: execute a block of code the specified number of times while the conditional statement is true.</p>
<p>for ... in: in to iterate through an array or an object's properties (loop through an array or an object's properties).</p>
<p>Function: defines a function.</p>
<p>if .... else:  used to perform different actions based on different conditions.</p>
<p>Return: Exit function.</p>
<p>Switch: is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.</p>
<p>Throw: throws (generates) an error.</p>
<p>Try: implements error handling and is used in conjunction with catch.</p>
<p>Var: Declares a variable.</p>
<p>Executes: the statement block while the conditional statement is true.</p>
